# Permissions

Rise B2B API uses role-based access control (RBAC) to secure all operations.

## Roles
- `team_admin`: Full access to team and payments
- `team_finance_admin`: Manage payments
- `team_viewer`: Read-only
- `user`: Limited to own data

## Scopes
- Each API call checks the user's role and scope
- Permissions are enforced on every endpoint

## Security Tips
- Assign the minimum required role
- Rotate admin roles regularly
- Audit access logs
