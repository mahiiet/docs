# RiseID

RiseID is the core identity system in the Rise ecosystem. Every user, team, and company gets its own RiseID once registered/created in the platform. The RiseID contract is deployed by Rise and all fees are paid by Rise - users do not have to pay any fees for contract deployment.

## What is RiseID?

A RiseID is a unique 42-character identifier that represents an entity in the Rise ecosystem. It follows the Ethereum address format: `0x` followed by 40 hexadecimal characters (e.g., `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`).

### RiseID Contract Structure

The RiseID contract can be thought of as a **collection of wallets**, where every wallet has a role inside the contract. This role determines what the wallet can/cannot do within the RiseID.

## RiseID Hierarchy

The RiseID system implements a hierarchical permission structure:

```
User RiseID (Owner: User's RSK)
    ↓
Company RiseID (Owner: User RiseID)
    ↓
Team RiseID (Owner: Company RiseID)
```

### Permission Bubbling

When a user wants to run a transaction in a Team RiseID, they sign with their RSK. Since the RSK is not directly added to the team RiseID, the team RiseID will "bubble up" the permission check through the hierarchy:

1. **Team RiseID** checks if RSK has permission → Not found
2. **Company RiseID** checks if RSK has permission → Not found  
3. **User RiseID** validates the RSK as a valid owner → **Permission granted**

This hierarchical structure allows for efficient permission management across the entire organization.

## RiseID Contract Features

### ERC725X and ERC725Y Implementation

The RiseID contract implements **ERC725X** and **ERC725Y** standards, which means:

- **ERC725X**: The owner can use the RiseID as a storage for any kind of information using key/value pairs
- **ERC725Y**: Supports calling arbitrary transactions through its `call` and `execute` functions

### Arbitrary Transaction Execution

Wallets controlling a RiseID can:
- Encode other contract calls
- Use the RiseID to execute operations
- Store and retrieve data using key/value pairs

## RiseID Types and Usage

### RiseID vs Nanoid Comparison

| Aspect | RiseID | Nanoid |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Format** | 42-character Ethereum address | Variable length string with prefix |
| **Usage** | Authentication and contract control | API operations and balance queries |
| **Example** | `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678` | `te-abc123def456` |
| **Purpose** | On-chain identity and permissions | API endpoint identifiers |

### When to Use RiseID

- **Authentication**: SIWE authentication flow
- **Contract Operations**: Smart contract interactions
- **Permission Management**: Role-based access control
- **On-chain Identity**: Blockchain-based identity verification

### When to Use Nanoid

- **API Operations**: Most API endpoints
- **Balance Queries**: Entity balance lookups
- **Team Management**: Team-related operations
- **Payment Processing**: Payment creation and management

## RiseID Recovery

### Recovery Process

RiseIDs are controlled by user-owned wallets. If a user loses access to their wallets, they become locked out of their RiseID and cannot perform actions like payments or withdrawals.

**Recovery Solution**: Rise can recover a RiseID by assigning it a new owner address chosen by the user.

### Recovery Steps

1. **Contact Support**: User contacts Rise support when locked out
2. **Identity Verification**: Support verifies user identity
3. **New Owner Assignment**: Rise assigns a new owner address
4. **Access Restoration**: User regains control of their RiseID

<Warning>
  **Important**: Always maintain secure backup of your wallet credentials. Recovery is available but should be used as a last resort.
</Warning>

## Security Considerations

### RiseID Security

- **42-character format**: RiseID must be exactly 42 characters (Ethereum address format)
- **Contract ownership**: Only authorized wallets can control RiseID contracts
- **Hierarchical permissions**: Permission checks bubble up through the hierarchy
- **Recovery mechanism**: Support can help recover lost access

### Best Practices

- **Secure wallet storage**: Use hardware wallets for high-value operations
- **Permission management**: Regularly review and update wallet permissions
- **Backup strategies**: Maintain secure backups of wallet credentials
- **Support contact**: Keep support contact information readily available

## Code Examples

### RiseID Format Validation

```javascript
function validateRiseID(riseid) {
  // RiseID must be exactly 42 characters (0x + 40 hex chars)
  const riseidRegex = /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/;
  return riseidRegex.test(riseid) && riseid.length === 42;
    }

// Example usage
const riseid = "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678";
console.log(validateRiseID(riseid)); // true
```

### RiseID vs Nanoid Usage

```javascript
// Authentication - Use RiseID
const authenticate = async (walletAddress, riseid) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/v2/auth/siwe?wallet=${walletAddress}&riseid=${riseid}`
  );
  return response.json();
};

// Balance query - Use Nanoid
const getBalance = async (nanoid) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/v2/balance?nanoid=${nanoid}`);
  return response.json();
};
```
