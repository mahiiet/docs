# Payments

Rise B2B API supports secure, on-chain payments for payroll and business operations.

## Payment Types
- Batch payments
- Individual payments

## Payment Flow
1. Create payment draft (get typedata)
2. Sign with wallet (EIP-712)
3. Submit signature
4. Track status

## Security

- Typedata signatures prevent tampering
- Use HTTPS and verify contract addresses

## Best Practices

- Monitor payment status via API
