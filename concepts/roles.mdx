# Roles & Permissions

Rise B2B API implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system that defines what users can do within companies and teams. Understanding these roles is essential for building secure integrations.

## Role Hierarchy

Rise uses a hierarchical permission system where company roles cascade down to team roles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Company Level" icon="building">
    Organization-wide roles that control company settings and team access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Level" icon="users">
    Team-specific roles that control team operations and member management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Company Roles

Company roles provide organization-wide permissions and automatically cascade to teams within the company.

## Role Hierarchy & Cascading

### Company to Team Role Mapping

When a user has a company role, it automatically grants them corresponding team roles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Company Role → Team Role" icon="arrow-down">
    <ul>
      <li><code>company</code> → <code>team_admin</code></li>
      <li><code>org_admin</code> → <code>team_admin</code></li>
      <li><code>org_finance_admin</code> → <code>team_finance_admin</code></li>
      <li><code>org_viewer</code> → <code>team_viewer</code></li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permission Inheritance" icon="shield">
    Company roles automatically grant equivalent team permissions across all teams in the organization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Roles Work in the API

### Permission Validation

The B2B API uses **permission validation** rather than role queries. When you make API calls, the system automatically checks if your user has the required permissions. If you lack permission, the API returns a 403 Forbidden error with details about what role is required.

### Error-Based Permission Discovery

Since there's no direct role query endpoint, you can discover user permissions through API responses. When an API call fails with a 403 error, the response will indicate what role is required for that operation.

## Role Management

### Assigning Roles

Roles can be assigned through the invite system using the `/v2/invites/manager` endpoint.

### Role Settings

You can access role-specific settings for team members using the team member settings endpoints.

## Security Best Practices

## Error Handling

Common role-related errors and solutions:

| HTTP Status | Error | Description | Solution |
|-------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `403` | `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` | User lacks required role | Check user's current role and upgrade if needed |
| `400` | `INVALID_ROLE` | Role doesn't exist or is invalid | Use one of the valid role types |
| `404` | `USER_NOT_FOUND` | User doesn't exist in the entity | Verify user is a member of the entity |
| `409` | `ROLE_CONFLICT` | Role assignment conflicts with existing role | Remove existing role before assigning new one |

### Common Error Scenarios

**Insufficient Permissions (403):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": "User us-abc123def456 must have admin access to team te-xyz789abc123. Current role: team_viewer"
}
```

**Invalid Role Assignment (400):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": "Invalid role: super_admin. Valid roles are: team_admin, team_finance_admin, team_viewer"
}
```

<Note>
  **Role Discovery**: Since there's no direct role query endpoint, you can discover user permissions by attempting API calls and handling 403 errors appropriately. The API will automatically validate permissions for each operation.
